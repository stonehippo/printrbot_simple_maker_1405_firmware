# Updated PrintrBot Firmware Updater

[The currently available version of the PrintrBot firmware updater](http://www.printrbottalk.com/wiki/index.php?title=User:PxT) is broken on newer versions of macOS. The version included here is the result of doing some surgery on the app package, replacing the old version of `cocaoDialog` and `dfu-programmer`. It worked great on macOS 12.14.
